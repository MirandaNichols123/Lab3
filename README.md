Choose one of your previous labs.
Choose Two Design Patterns.
Design and implement improvements to your prior lab submission based on your chosen Design patterns.
Provide the first Commit of this project with the commit message: "Start implementing design patterns for Lab Four"
 
In the Readme Document and/or text submission for this project:
Name the two patterns you wish to implement and explain what advantages you hope to achieve with them.
Describe how you implement the patterns, including additional interfaces, and classes, and how these will integrate with the classes that you already have.
Implement the changes.
Include a link to your repository.


1. Observer Pattern
   Some advantages to this would be that multiple panels can observe changes in the TablePanel, allowing   
   more flexibility and easier maintenance. 
3. Factory Pattern
   One advantage is the creation of instances of an object(different chart types/panels) that 
   are dynamically based on user input or other conditions. This avoids hardcoded new statements that are scattered 
   throughout the program

Together these patterns will enhance modularity, flexibility, and maintainability
